"Aberdeen Sites and Monuments Record (SMR)","The Aberdeen Sites and Monuments Record is maintained by the Archaeology Section, Aberdeen City Council.  The SMR includes upstanding identifiable sites from prehistoric stone circles and cairns, through medieval buildings to World War II defences such as pillboxes and anti-tank blocks. The sites also include documentary records: sites which were once recorded but have either been lost many years previously or demolished more recently. The sites also include features that have been identified by aerial photography but not investigated further, archaeological excavations and observations, and find spots. Finds vary from collections of several hundred flint tools collected by local historians to the finding of an individual object while digging the garden. Finds cover all date ranges over the last 8000 years from mesolithic flints to 20th-century ceramics and objects associated with World War II.  The SMR consists, at the present moment, of nearly 1700 records. Each site is represented by both a paper record and an entry on a Geographical Information System,  which links a point on a map and a database of information. Details of the sites are held along with photographs, press cuttings and reports regarding the  history and condition of the site. The SMR is open for consultation by appointment. <br>Status: On-going development",""District:Aberdeen;Country:Scotland;","Period:Mesolithic;Period:Iron Age;Subject:Pre-Christian/pagan funerary and cult ritual;Subject:Communications;Subject:Secular architecture and structures;Period:Roman;Period:Post Medieval;Period:Neolithic;Subject:Historic landscape;Subject:Rural and urban settlement;Period:Palaeolithic;Subject:Warfare and defence;Subject:Christian monuments, buildings and ritual;Subject:Artefacts;Period:Late Medieval;Period:Bronze Age;","Import RCN:HEIR-331;","Publisher:Whitespace;",,http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=953469

"East Lothian Historic Environment Record","The East Lothian Historic Environment Record or HER is a record of all known archaeological and historical sites in East and Midlothian.  The HER is maintained by the East Lothian Council Archaeology Service based in Haddington.

The HER records archaeological sites from the Palaeolithic period (500,000 BC) to nearly the modern day.   This covers a range of types of sites, historic buildings, and finds, from prehistoric standing stones to World War II airfields.  The HER also holds details of Scheduled Ancient Monuments, Listed Buildings, and Historic Parks and Gardens, as well as records of recent archaeological fieldwork.

The HER is based on a computerised database with over 17,000 records, which is linked to GIS mapping.  This is supplemented with a wide range of material, including fieldwork reports, photographs, plans, aerial photographs, and historic maps.  The database is updated regularly with new finds and discoveries.  The HER is a key resource used by the Archaeology Service to advise on planning matters, forestry, utilities, roads, etc.  The HER is also used by members of the public, consultants, history societies, students, and academics.  It is a resource that is available for anyone who is interested in finding out about the archaeology and heritage of East and Midlothian.  

We do not have the facilities for members of the public to visit the HER in person, but we can be contacted by phone, email, or letter.  Status: On-going development",""Country:Scotland;Named Location:East Lothian;Named Location:Midlothian;","Period:Early Medieval;Period:Mesolithic;Period:Iron Age;Subject:Pre-Christian/pagan funerary and cult ritual;Subject:Communications;Subject:Secular architecture and structures;Period:Roman;Subject:Christian monuments;Period:Post Medieval;Period:Neolithic;Period:Modern;Subject:Historic landscape;Subject:Ships and boats;Subject:Rural and urban settlement;Period:Medieval;Period:Palaeolithic;Subject:Warfare and defence;Subject:Artefacts;Subject: buildings and ritual;Period:Bronze Age;","Import RCN:HEIR-523;","Publisher:East Lothian Council Archaeology Service;",,http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=1686206
