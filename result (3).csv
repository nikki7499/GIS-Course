"Aberdeen Sites and Monuments Record (SMR)","The Aberdeen Sites and Monuments Record is maintained by the Archaeology Section, Aberdeen City Council.  The SMR includes upstanding identifiable sites from prehistoric stone circles and cairns, through medieval buildings to World War II defences such as pillboxes and anti-tank blocks. The sites also include documentary records: sites which were once recorded but have either been lost many years previously or demolished more recently. The sites also include features that have been identified by aerial photography but not investigated further, archaeological excavations and observations, and find spots. Finds vary from collections of several hundred flint tools collected by local historians to the finding of an individual object while digging the garden. Finds cover all date ranges over the last 8000 years from mesolithic flints to 20th-century ceramics and objects associated with World War II.  The SMR consists, at the present moment, of nearly 1700 records. Each site is represented by both a paper record and an entry on a Geographical Information System,  which links a point on a map and a database of information. Details of the sites are held along with photographs, press cuttings and reports regarding the  history and condition of the site. The SMR is open for consultation by appointment. <br>Status: On-going development",""District:Aberdeen;Country:Scotland;","Period:Mesolithic;Period:Iron Age;Subject:Pre-Christian/pagan funerary and cult ritual;Subject:Communications;Subject:Secular architecture and structures;Period:Roman;Period:Post Medieval;Period:Neolithic;Subject:Historic landscape;Subject:Rural and urban settlement;Period:Palaeolithic;Subject:Warfare and defence;Subject:Christian monuments, buildings and ritual;Subject:Artefacts;Period:Late Medieval;Period:Bronze Age;","Import RCN:HEIR-331;","Publisher:Whitespace;",,http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=953469
